-- Migration 004: Avatar upload support

-- 1. Add avatar_path column to profiles
ALTER TABLE public.profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS avatar_path TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '';

-- 2. Storage RLS for avatars bucket (private — served via signed URLs)
-- Create bucket in Supabase Dashboard: Storage → New Bucket → "avatars", UNCHECK "Public bucket"

CREATE POLICY "Users upload own avatar" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text);

CREATE POLICY "Users select own avatar" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text);

CREATE POLICY "Users update own avatar" ON storage.objects
  FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
  USING (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text);

CREATE POLICY "Users delete own avatar" ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE TO authenticated
  USING (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text);
